    // 2) A reference to a class CAN be assigned to a superclass reference without an explicit cast (A Beagle is always a Dog)
    // 3) A reference to an interface CANNOT be assigned to a reference of a class that implements the interface without an explicit cast
    //    Â¦__ An interface does not inherit from a class
    // 4) An explicit cast is NOT required to assign a reference to a class that implements an interface to a reference of the interface

        beagleReferenceA = (Beagle)dogReferenceA; // Compiles, but will throw a Runtime Error ClassCastException since dogReferenceA is now a Basset
